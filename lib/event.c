/**
 * DOC: Events
 *
 * Events are there to keep track of deferred execution.
 * Since BIRD is single-threaded, it requires long lasting tasks to be split to smaller
 * parts, so that no module can monopolize the CPU. To split such a task, just create
 * an &event resource, point it to the function you want to have called and call ev_schedule()
 * to ask the core to run the struct event when nothing more important requires attention.
 *
 * You can also define your own struct event lists (the &event_list structure), enqueue your
 * events in them and explicitly ask to run them.
