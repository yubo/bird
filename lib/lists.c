/**
 * DOC: Linked lists
 *
 * The BIRD library provides a set of functions for operating on linked
 * lists. The lists are internally represented as standard doubly linked
 * lists with synthetic head and tail which makes all the basic operations
 * run in constant time and contain no extra end-of-list checks. Each list
 * is described by a &list structure, nodes can have any format as long
 * as they start with a &node structure. If you want your nodes to belong
 * to multiple lists at once, you can embed multiple &node structures in them
 * and use the SKIP_BACK() macro to calculate a pointer to the start of the
 * structure from a &node pointer, but beware of obscurity.
 *
 * There also exist safe linked lists (&slist, &snode and all functions
 * being prefixed with |s_|) which support asynchronous walking very
 * similar to that used in the &fib structure.
